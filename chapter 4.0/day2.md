## Quests

**1. Instead of console logging the result after the script executes, I want you to:**
<br>i. Make a new variable named greeting using useState
<br>ii. Set the greeting variable to the response of the script call
<br>iii. Create a `<p>` tag after the `<div className={styles.flex}>` tag
<br>iv. Put the greeting variable inside of that `<p>` tag. This will make the result of your script show on your webpage!

**2. I deployed a contract called SimpleTest to an account with an address of 0x6c0d53c676256e8c.** 
I want you to make a button that, when clicked, executes a script to read the number variable from that contract. 
If you're curious, you can see the contract here: https://flow-view-source.com/testnet/account/0x6c0d53c676256e8c/contract/SimpleTest

Submit all the code you used to call the script, and the result of the script.

**3. Then, I want you to remove the button, and make the script execute every time the page refreshes.**

Submit all the code you used to do this.
